## 🔒 Privacy & Security Status

### Current Implementation Limitations

**⚠️ Important Privacy Notice**: The current system uses traditional `xpub`-based multisig setups with known privacy limitations:

1. **Provider Snooping**: Providers can monitor blockchain for any transaction using their `xpub` and see the entire multisig wallet's transaction history
2. **Platform Trust**: Users must trust Seed-E doesn't log or misuse `xpub` data
3. **Limited Extortion Protection**: 7-day time delay provides some protection but doesn't prevent extortion

### Privacy Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Chain Code Delegation (Target: Q2 2024)

- **Status**: Researching wallet compatibility (Sparrow, Specter Desktop, Coldcard)
- **Goal**: Prevent provider snooping by withholding chain codes
- **Implementation**: Providers submit only public keys, clients generate chain codes
- **Dependency**: Wallet support for chain code delegation

#### Phase 2: Blind Schnorr Signatures (Target: Q3 2024)

- **Status**: Planning implementation approach
- **Goal**: Full transaction privacy from providers
- **Implementation**: Combine Chain Code Delegation with blind Schnorr signatures
- **Dependency**: Taproot adoption and wallet support

#### Phase 3: FROST Threshold Signatures (Target: Q4 2024)

- **Status**: Researching FROST protocol implementation
- **Goal**: Ultimate privacy with single aggregate signatures
- **Implementation**: Multi-party computation for threshold signatures
- **Dependency**: Schnorr/Taproot ecosystem maturity
