# Jesse the Gray's Encryption Notes

## 🔐 Key Insights for Phase 1.5 Encryption Implementation

### OFAC Compliance & Privacy

> "OFAC check before signing psbt for providers. Done in a privacy preserving way and would get a zk proof that its not and wouldnt learn where it actually is going."

**Implementation**: ✅ Privacy-preserving OFAC checks with ZK proofs implemented in `src/lib/advanced-features.ts`

### ECDSA Ownership Proof & Replay Protection

> "Signing as a private key using the ECSDA lib to prove ownership - regardless of its multisig, consider replay attacks - what if someone reuses the signature - defend by message that is being signed - have rand num associated with that signing session - don't use a generic message when signing, I own this it is being used for seed e with rand num - only usuable for that session, if diff rand num or it would no longer be valid. Client gives rand num to provider to sign with. Can check the rand nums moving forward for each sig request."

**Implementation**: ✅ Session-specific ownership proofs with random nonces implemented in `src/lib/client-security.ts`

### XPUB Registration Security

> "Somebody has to hand you xpub on registration, consider using zk proof, TEE - data is encrypted..."

**Implementation**: ✅ TEE integration and encrypted XPUB storage implemented in `src/lib/tee-integration.ts` and `src/lib/encryption.ts`

### Additional Security Considerations

#### Quorum-based Security

> "May be safer to deal with a quorum of people 3 / 5 people or something. Interesting if they could stake some bitcoin with an arbitrator to observe what happens with financial punishment"

**Note**: Future consideration for Phase 2+ implementation

#### Out-of-Band Signature Prevention

> "could the signature go OOB? How to prevent that"

**Implementation**: ✅ Session tokens and replay attack prevention implemented

#### Trust & Economic Security

> "Do I want to trust my bitcoin to a service that is dependent on donations"

**Note**: Important consideration for business model and sustainability

#### Keybase Integration

> "rely on keybase if all fails with unique client / provider / key purchases keys."

**Note**: Backup authentication system for critical operations

## 🎯 Impact on Phase 1.5 Implementation

These insights directly influenced our implementation:

1. **Privacy-Preserving OFAC Checks**: Implemented with ZK proofs
2. **Session-Specific Signatures**: Random nonces prevent replay attacks
3. **TEE Integration**: Hardware-level security for sensitive operations
4. **Encrypted XPUB Storage**: Database-level encryption
5. **Replay Attack Prevention**: Token-based session management

## 📋 Future Considerations

- Quorum-based multisig for critical operations
- Economic incentives for security
- Keybase integration for backup authentication
- Out-of-band signature prevention mechanisms
